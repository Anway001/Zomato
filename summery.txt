This project is a full-stack clone of Zomato, a popular food delivery platform. It is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and is divided into two main parts: a backend server and a frontend client.

Backend Features:
- RESTful API: Built with Express.js and Node.js.
- Database: Uses MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling.
- Authentication: Implements JWT-based authentication for both regular users and food partners, with separate registration and login flows.
- User Features:
  - CRUD operations for user profiles.
  - Follow/unfollow other users.
- Food & Restaurant Features:
  - Food partners can create, update, and delete food items.
  - Users can browse and search for food.
- Order Management:
  - Users can place orders.
  - Food partners can view and manage incoming orders.
- Social Interactions:
  - Users can like and comment on food items.
  - Users can save their favorite food items.
- Storage: Includes services for handling file storage (e.g., for food images).

Frontend Features:
- Modern UI: Built with React and Vite for a fast development experience.
- Component-Based Architecture: The application is structured into reusable components for different features.
- Routing: Uses a router to handle navigation between different pages.
- State Management: Utilizes React Context for managing global state, such as the shopping cart.
- User-Facing Application:
  - Home page to explore food.
  - Detailed view for each food product.
  - Shopping cart functionality.
  - Checkout process to place an order.
  - Order history to track past orders.
  - A "Saved" section for favorite items.
- Food Partner Dashboard:
  - A dedicated interface for food partners to manage their offerings.
  - Create new food listings.
  - View and manage incoming customer orders.
  - Manage their profile.

Overall Architecture:
The project follows a client-server architecture. The React frontend communicates with the Node.js/Express backend via API calls. The backend handles all business logic, database interactions, and authentication, while the frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface and managing the user experience.
